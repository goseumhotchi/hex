# HEX

Hex is a deliberately simple and fast note-taking tool which doubles as a publishing pipeline to [blot](http://blot.im).

## Installation

Hex is built on [electron](https://electronjs.org). It is meant to be compiled as a portable application to be either hauled around on a USB stick or put in your dropbox. To compile a portable windows application, run

    npm install && npm run dist

from the root folder on the command line. The compiled `.exe` resides in the `dist` folder.

## Usage

Hex runs minimized to the system tray and registers two global keyboard shortcuts: `ctrl + alt + N` to open a new window for composing; and `ctrl + alt + F` to opend the find interface.

### How do I write a new note?

Hit the global keyboard shortcut `ctrl + alt + N` to bring up the editing window and start typing. When you are done, simply press `esc` to close the window. Your work will be saved.

### How do I read or edit existing notes?

Hit the global keyboard shortcut `ctrl + alt + F` to bring up the find interface. Type a search string and hit enter. Hex will provide a list or results you can navigate through with the arrow keys. Press `enter` to view or edit an existing entry.

Search results are sorted by date, most recent entry first. The search currently looks for the provided substring in the full text of the entry, including tags.

### How do I tag my notes?

Type the pound/sharp/hash symbol '#' to start a hashtag. Hitting `space` or `enter` will close the tag, remove it from the text and add it to the hash tag list on top of the editing interface. 
To delete a previously entered hashtag, click on it with the mouse.

### How do I delete entries?

Find and select the entry you wish to delete. In the editing interface, hold `ctrl + d` and watch the note fade. When the editing window closes, the note is deleted. If you have second thoughts, just release `ctrl + d` before the note is fully gone.

If you hold `ctrl + d` on an entry that was not previously saved, the editing window will remain open to allow you to try again.

### How do i publish to Blot?

In the editing interface, hit `ctrl + p` to publish or unpublish your note. Hex will export your content, including hashtags, to your blot folder, as soon as you save your note.

### Where is my data?

Hex stores all content in a file called `hex.db`
